## Introduction

Understanding temperature variations and anomalies is crucial for various sectors such as agriculture, energy, and climate science. This project aims to analyze temperature data and anomalies to identify trends, outliers, and correlations. By examining the relationship between temperature and anomalies, we seek to understand the impact of environmental factors on temperature fluctuations.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

We load temperature data from a CSV file and preprocess it to handle missing values and ensure data consistency. Preprocessing steps include filling missing values with means, converting data types, and adding new columns for enhanced analysis. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis involves visualizing temperature trends over time and across different countries. We plot temperature variations, anomalies, and trends to identify patterns and insights. Additionally, we analyze summary statistics to understand the distribution of temperature data.

## Outlier Detection

Outliers in temperature data can indicate extreme weather events or measurement errors. We employ outlier detection techniques to identify countries or time periods with unusually high or low temperatures. By removing outliers, we ensure the robustness of our analysis and modeling.

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis helps us understand the relationship between temperature variations and anomalies. We calculate correlation coefficients to quantify the strength and direction of this relationship. By examining correlations, we gain insights into how anomalies are influenced by changes in temperature.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of temperature variations and anomalies, offering insights into environmental trends and patterns. By analyzing temperature data across different countries and time periods, we uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making in various sectors. Understanding the relationship between temperature and anomalies is essential for addressing climate-related challenges and mitigating their impact on society and the environment
